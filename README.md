## Description
A webpage to display my works to give future employers an example of what i'm capable of.
This webpage utilizes elements of HTML and CSS learned in class, making use of flexboxes in order to have a pleasing display. 
This project taught me many things about how to manipulate flexboxes, and general CSS atributes. 

## Installation

There are no steps to instal this project apart from opening the page.

## Usage
Clicking the nav bar scrolls down to its respective part of the page.
Contacts a the bottom properly link to social media.
Clicking the large image directs to the github page of its respective project. 
Hovering over any image under "work" will highlight it.
The large image has a title that appears when hoverd over. This is the only one that does this since I have only completed 1 other project.

## Credits

ChatGPT was used to tell me that I accidentally spelled a class title differently between the HTML and CSS pages.
